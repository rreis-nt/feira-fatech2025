# TODO: Styling Site with Fixed Background Images

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Add background-attachment: fixed; to CSS selectors with background images (header, #faq, .responsaveis-bg, .section-bg)
- [ ] Test the parallax scrolling effect by opening the site in a browser
- [ ] Optionally update images if they don't fit well (e.g., replace with more modern ones)
- [ ] Adjust background-size or position if needed for better visual effect
